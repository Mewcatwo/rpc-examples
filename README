This repository includes small example applications that use rs-485 port of the raspicomm.

- rs485_write
 An example application that sends a Hello World message over the rs-485 port.

- rs485_read
 An example application that receives 10 bytes from the rs-485 port and displays them afterwards.

- rs485_poll
  A more sophisticated version of rs485_read that uses the poll() system call to wait for rs-485 data and keyboard events at the same time without consuming cpu time.

How to use the examples:
0. use git to clone this repository 
 'git clone https://github.com/amescon/rpc-examples.git'

1. build the examples applications with make and run them
 1.1 rs485_write
  'cd ./rs485_write'
  'make'
  './rs485_write'

 1.2 rs485_read
  'cd rs485_read'
  'make'
  './rs485_read'

 1.3 rs485_poll
  'cd rs485_poll'
  'make'
  './rs485_poll'

2. modify the code and play around with it
