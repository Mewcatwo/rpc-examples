This repository includes small example applications that use the RS-485 port of the Raspicomm. Here is how to use it:

- Use GIT to clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi:
  git clone https://github.com/amescon/rpc-examples.git

- The repository includes the following sample apps:
  - rs485_write
    Sends "Hello World" over the RS-485 port.
  - rs485_read
    Receives 10 bytes from the RS-485 port and displays them afterwards.
  - rs485_poll
    A more sophisticated version of rs485_read that uses the poll() system call to wait for RS-485 data and keyboard events at the same time without consuming cpu time.

- Change to the directory of the application that you want to run, e.g.:
  cd rpc-examples/rs485_write

- Compile the code into an executable:
  make

- Run it, e.g.:
  ./rs485_write

- Time to have some fun! Modify the code, compile it once more and test your changes!
